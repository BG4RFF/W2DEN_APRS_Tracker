The W2DEN_APRS_Tracker is a Teensy 3.1 (PJRC) project that will result in a low cost, easy to replicate APRS tracker that can be interfaced to almost any radio.
Build details can be cound on the Sarasota Emergency Radio Club's web site on the Elmer pages.

This project is a combination of many Arduino based APRS trackers found on the internet. As well as some of my own twists.
